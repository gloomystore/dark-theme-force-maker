## Changelog

### 1.0.2
- **Enhanced Dark Mode Application for a Wider Range of Colors**  
  Improved the dark mode functionality by extending its application to a broader spectrum of colors. Leveraged advanced color analysis using HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) to identify and convert not only light shades but also intermediate gray tones to a deeper, more consistent dark theme. This update ensures that a greater variety of background and text colors are converted to dark mode, enhancing readability and user experience across diverse websites.

### 1.0.3
- **Expanded Support for iFrames and Shadow DOM**  
  Introduced comprehensive support for applying dark mode within embedded iFrames and Shadow DOMs. This update ensures that dark mode styles are propagated seamlessly across all nested content, including third-party embedded content and encapsulated components within Shadow DOM. The extension now fully integrates dark mode across all layers of web page structures, providing a unified and immersive dark theme experience regardless of content embedding or web component isolation.
